## Security & Cryptography

hash functions - git
public keys - ssh

Entropy is a measure of randomness. This is useful, for example, when determining the strength of a password
Measured in bits

## hash functions
A cryptographic hash function maps data of arbitrary size to a fixed size, and has some special properties. A rough specification of a hash function is as follows:
sha1 => input of bits => 160 bits of o/p

Properties:
- non-invertible
- collision resistant

 Why git uses cryptographic hash fns. ?
- to prevent conflicts in hash fns. to prevent hash collision

sha1sum of files help know authencity

publish hash of file -> 160 bits of data

download file
if hash match it is safe
or else it is backdoored yada/yada

## Commmitment scheme

A way to visualize a commitment scheme is to think of a sender as putting a message in a locked box, 
and giving the box to a receiver. The message in the box is hidden from the receiver, who cannot open the lock themselves. 
Since the receiver has the box, the message inside cannot be changedâ€”merely revealed if the sender chooses to give them the key at some later time.

Interactions in a commitment scheme take place in two phases:

    the commit phase during which a value is chosen and specified
    the reveal phase during which the value is revealed and checked

## tools
-sha1sum -. generate sha1 from stdin

## Key dervation functions(KDF)

### Properties
- is slow to compute

PBKDF2 -password based KDF2

## Symmetric key cryptography

Fns.
- Key generation fn keygen()
- encrypt (text,key) => ciphertext
- decrypt (ciphetext,key) => plaintext 
-
