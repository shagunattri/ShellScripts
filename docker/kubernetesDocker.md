k8s is a containers orchestration system and orchestates container using docker which allows applications to stay in containers.

application should run on any environment as the application is separated from the host and also allow dependencies also in the applications.

You can run multiple containers and create a microservers and distribute the work and make the whole thing as an application.

k8s help in horizantal scale the application.

Our PC helps deploy the applicaton on the server. A load on the server needs to be answered with more servers where we can use a load balancer to manage the load.

We need to setup a k8s cluster and use the kubectl to configure the k8s with .yaml files to host your docker application.
