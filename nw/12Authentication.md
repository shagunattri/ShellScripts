### Authentication

- Proving who you are
    - Several methods can be used for this
- We can't expose our info to others
    - Non-repudiation

### Multi factor Authentication

In three ways:
- Something you `have`
- Something you `are`
- Something you `know`

###  Single Sign-on
- Authentication passed to other servers
- Improved ease of use
- One login to access other profiles and services with a single login reducing friction.
