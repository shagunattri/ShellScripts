### Public Key Infrastructure

What is PKI?
- PKI is based on asymmetric encryption
- In the pki we have CA(certficate authority)

To talk bw companies they use the CA as the main trust source 

CA is the key manager creating the public,private kes for the companies

Where the companies then sign keys and talk to each other and send data

User the private key to encrypt the data and send

The other company then asks the public key of sender to the use it and decrypt the message.

on valid signatures made by the keys with CA can be decrypted only not others.
