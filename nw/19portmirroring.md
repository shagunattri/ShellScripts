### Port Mirroring

- Technique that allows us to see a copy of what is coming through the network 
- Look at the package by looking at a copy of the packet to understand.
- Switch deals with the packages and send them to its specific port.

 If we have a client,router server and an IDS on port 4 we can then

 use it to then write rule to go from all the prots to port 4 where the IDS will check the pkgs and detect any harmful packages
 with its rules

 IDS monitors looking for logs and packets to finds malicious pkgs.

 Then IPS comes in play b/w the router and switch to manage the malicious pkgs from the IDS.
