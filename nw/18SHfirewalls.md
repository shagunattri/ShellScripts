### Software Hardware Firewalls

- What is a Firewall ?
- Scans all incoming/outgoing network traffic
- Defend against malicious traffic
- Most come with its own firewall Eg:Windows firewall
    - Can have two forms:
        - Software Firewall
        - Hardware Firewall

### Software Firewall

- Installed on clients
    - Have all client information
    - Make very specific rules
        - Rules define how good the firewall is
        - Using ports/protocols and maintain rules to access/deny parts of the system

- Inexpensive but vulnerable
    - Vulnerable to OS attacks.

### Hardware Firewall

- Physical Devices
- Most robust,configurable
- In the router/switch/server.
- Can analyze all the n/w 
- Designed to handle traffic from computers.

### Port Security
Essential in firewall rules

- Two types of ports:
    - Logical (TCP/IP) ports 
    - Physical Ports

- Traffic is defined using IP and Port.

### Combination of both software and Hardware
- By combining physical firewall with routers/switches we achieve several advantages
    - Save money
    - Save Time

- Our defense is broken if our device is,so we need to combine not only a device and a hardware firewall but both hardware and software firewalls.
