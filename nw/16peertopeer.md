### Peer to Peer / Client to server N/w

#### Peer to Peer
- Topology where clients talk to clients
    - share files/folders
- Easy to setup/install
- Limited scale/performance
- no centralization
- cannot setup group policy

#### Client to Server
- Client  connected through server
- More scalable/better management
- harder initial setup

Both topologies are used in different cases.
