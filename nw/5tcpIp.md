### TCP/IP

- A suite of protocols for the internet  used to communicate aganist other devices.
- It is a common language implemented by devices to communicate  b/w each other.

### TCP
Transmission control protocol

- Ensures verified delivery to endpoint
- One -> one commmunication
- Every time a package is sent the reciever,it acknowledges(ACK) the package and gets message back
- MAny other protocolos utilise the TCP protocol including protocols such as ssh,pop3,http.

### IP
internet protocol

- Allows to go one step above mac addr(used in hubs)
- Delivers packets to devices
- Maps logical -> physical
    
    `IP -> MAC`

- It is a routable protocol



### Basic TCP/IP protocol suite

- TCP is layer 4

- IP is layer 3

- TCP uses the IP protocol to do dns queries and used by pop3,http.sssh

- UDP also relies on IP layer.

- TCP uses ACK on transfer.

- UDP needs no confirmation on delivery used in DHCP


### Protocols

- ARP 

Address resolution protocol layer 

It is used to map ip to mac addr
- DNS layer 5 

Resolves endpoints and domains

- DHCP 
Is to hand out ips to local n/w.
