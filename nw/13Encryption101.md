### Encryption 101

#### What is Encryption?
- We start with clear text
    - Our goal is cypher text
- Encryption/Decryption is accomplished with mathematical algorithms that are secure and not easy to crack.
- Algo stays the same but has different keys and passphrase

EG: SHAGUN

Algo = Data +K 1  //Everyone will know the algo but not the exact no to make it random where 1 is a secret number.

O/P:T I B H V O

### Types of Encryption

#### Symmetric Keys
- Encryption ans decryption use the same key.
- Eg: DES,TripleDES,AES,RC5

#### Asymmetric Keys
- Encryption and decryption use different keys, a public and a private key.
- Public key allows to decrypt the message and use the it to broadcast.
- Eg:RSA,Elliptic curve

#### One - Way Hash
- Hah value into cipher where it cannot be traced to origin text.
- Eg MD5,SHA-1
